There are three scenarios, wheel3, wheel4 and dumbbell.

To try those scenarios, load the corresponding imn file in CORE. 

There are two versions of imn files in each sub-folder, i.e., dumbbell.imn and dumbbellapp.imn. 

The former one contains only the topology, and you have to run ./runDumbbell script on each node mannually.

The latter(/w app) one has topology and automatic execution. It only outputs running time results of each terminal node to the files in ../stat .
